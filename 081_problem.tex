Let a ``polyarc'' be a path composed of quarter circular arcs, and a polyarc-configuration be
a placement of polyarcs on an $n \times m$ grid such that no part of a polyarc is
inside another polyarc.

\begin{question}
  How many such polyarc-configurations exist on the $n \times m$ grid?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if polyarcs can be inside other polyarcs?
  \item What if all polyarcs must be tangent to another polyarc?
  \item With if the polyarc-configuration must be connected?
  \item What configuration gives maximum area for the entire polyarc-configuration?
  \item Can this be done on a triangular/hexagonal grid with $1/3$ or $1/6$ arcs?
  \item How many different non-self-intersecting $4$-robot walks can fit inside
    of an $n \times m$ grid? Self-intersecting?
  \item What if instead of quarter circles, boxes were made with diagonal line
    segments?
  \item Is there a nice multi-dimensional analog?
