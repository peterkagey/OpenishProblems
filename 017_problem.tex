  Start with $n$ piles with a single stone in each pile. If two piles have the
  same number of stones, then any number of stones can be moved between them.

\begin{question}
  What is the greatest number of steps that can occur? Alternatively how many
  ``levels'' are in the tree of possible moves?
\end{question}

  \item Let $s$ be the total number of distinct states.
    (The example shows that $s(5) = 6$.)
  \item Let $c$ be the total number of states that \textit{cannot} be acheived.
    (In the example, $c(5) = 1$ via the state $(5)$.)
  \item Is $c(p) = 1$ for all primes $p$?
  \item Is $c(n) = 0$ if and only if $n$ is a power of $2$?
  \item Let $\ell$ be the least number of steps to a terminal state.
    (In the example, $\ell(5) = 3$ ending in the state $(4,1)$.)
  \item Let $g$ be the greatest number of steps to a terminal state.
    (In the example, $g(5) = 4$ ending in the state $(3,2)$.)
  \item Let $p$ be the total number of paths.
    (In the example, $p(5) = 2$.)
  \item Let $t$ be the number of distinct \textit{terminal} states.
    (In the example, $t(5) = 2$ with states $(4,1)$ and $(3,2)$.)
