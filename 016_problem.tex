  Richard Guy beat me to this problem by a few years. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5099).\\
  John Conway described the ``Subprime Fibonacci Sequence'': \[
    a(1) = a, a(2) = b, a(n + 1) = \operatorname{gpd}(a(n) + a(n - 1)),
  \] where $\operatorname{gpd}(k)$ is the greatest proper divisor of $k$.\\
  Conway then conjectured that regardless of the starting terms, the sequence
  ends in a handful of cycles. Richard Guy found that there are more cycles than
  those that Conway conjectured.

\begin{question}
  What are all of the different possible end behaviors of
  Conway's Subprime Fibonacci Sequence?
\end{question}
