John Conway described the ``Subprime Fibonacci Sequence'': \[
  a(1) = \alpha, a(2) = \beta, a(n + 1) = \operatorname{gpd}(a(n) + a(n - 1)),
\] where $\operatorname{gpd}(k)$ is the greatest proper divisor of $k$.\\
Conway then conjectured that regardless of the starting terms, the sequence
ends in a handful of cycles.
\begin{question}
  What are all of the different possible end behaviors of
  Conway's Subprime Fibonacci Sequence?
\end{question}

\begin{note}
  Richard Guy beat me to this problem by a few years.\\
  Richard Guy found that there are more cycles than
  those that Conway conjectured.
