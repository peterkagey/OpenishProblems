Suppose a snail chooses a direction uniformly at random and walks a random
distance $d_\text{free}$ according to some distribution. The snail then
repeats the process. However, if the snail turns in a direction that faces its
trail, it walks a distance $d_\text{trail}$ chosen uniformly at random between
0 and the distance to the trail.

    An (actually) random walk where the change in $x$ and $y$ were

    escape from its confine for good?

\begin{question}
  What is the probability that the walk is unbounded?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item If the walk is bounded with probability 1, what is the expected
    distance of the walk?
  \item What if the angle is chosen uniformly at random from
    $\{2\pi/n, 4\pi/2, \hdots 2(n-1)\pi/n\}$? And $d_\text{free}$ is uniform
    on $[0, 1]$.
  \item What is the expected number of (avoided) collisions after $k$ steps?
