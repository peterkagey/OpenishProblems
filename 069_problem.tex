  A snail travels along the grid in unit steps---but it hates crossing its
  trail, so if a step is going to cross is trail, it will only go half way.

\begin{question}
  Let $a(n)$ be the minimum number of steps the snail must take before it can
  take a step of size $(2n-1)/2^k$. What is $a(n)$?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What if the snail must always turn left or right?
  \item What if the snail is walking on a triangular or hexagonal grid?
  \item What is the set of points the snail can step on after finitely many steps?
  \item How many distinct points can the snail reach after $m$ steps?
