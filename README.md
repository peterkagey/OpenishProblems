# Open(ish) Problems
## Background
  For several years now, I have been collecting interesting problems that I have thought of, come across, or been told about.
  For many of these problems, I have written letters to a friend asking for thoughts.
  For some of them, I have written some programs and made [OEIS](https://oeis.org/search?q=author%3akagey&sort=created) sequences.
  For a few, I have come up with some interesting new ideas.

  In late 2017, I started cataloging these problems, and by January 2018, I had written down 63 of them in a notebook.
  On December 11th, 2018 I removed about a dozen of the less interesting problems and started a version 2 of the collection.

  This project is an attempt to catalogue all of the problems that I've been thinking about and help me to not forget about them.

## Contributing
  If you're interested, here are some things you can do to help:
  * Let me know if you spot any typos or ambiguities.
  * Author an OEIS sequence related to a problem. (And let me know about it!)
  * Send me an email if you see that I haven't contributed to this project in a while.
  * Submit pull requests with links, references, examples, or solutions.
  * Add related questions.

## Example
  One of my earliest questions is related to the number of ways to weave coffee stirrers
  in such a way that they form a self-supporting structure,
  where removing any coffee stirrer results in the structure collapsing.
  I remember learning about one of these (5 stirrer) weaves when I was in elementary school,
  and I have since wondered what sorts of other configurations exist.

  More details about this problem can be found in v2/004_problem.pdf.

## Goals
  In February 2018, I met my goal to typeset problems 18â€“47.
