There are two popular, essentially identical, iPhone games in the app store:
\textit{AMAZE!!!} and \textit{Roller Splat!}.
The goal of the puzzle is to reach every (white) square in the board---the catch
is that you can only move in as-long-as-possible rook moves.

    Starting from the lower right corner, the board can be filled using the following $25$ moves: $

\begin{question}
  How many solvable puzzles exist on an $n \times m$ board?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if we only want to count ``primitive'' puzzles---those that cannot
  exist on a smaller board?
  \item What if we count up to symmetries of the rectangle?
  \item Which puzzle requires the greatest number of moves?
  \item What if we do this on a torus? M\"obius strip? More dimensions?
  \item Given some configuration, what is an algorithm to figure out how to solve it?
