Consider pairs subsets of $[n] = \{ 1, 2, 3, \hdots, n \}$ such that the
arithmetic mean of the subsets is equal. How many different pairs of subsets
can we find, up to some sort of depedence, where two pairs are equivalent if
there exists a linear transformation that takes one pair to the other, or
if there exists a ``chain'' of subsets that implies equality.

  \begin{align}
    \left(\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{1 + 3 + 5}{3}\right) &\cong
    \left(\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{3}\right)
    \\
    \left(\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{3}{1}\right) &\cong
    \left(\frac{3}{1} = \frac{2 + 4}{2}\right) \Longrightarrow \left(\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{2 + 4}{2}\right)
  \end{align}
  \caption{The first equalities are considered equivalent under the linear
    transformation $x \mapsto \frac{1}{2}(x + 5)$. The equality
    $\frac{1}{2}(1 + 5) = \frac{1}{2}(2 + 4)$ is a combination of
    equations (1) and (2), and so is not an independent equation.}

\begin{question}
  Is there some notion of a ``basis'' for these pairs of subsets, from which we
  can work out all pairs with equal means?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What is the minimal ``basis'' that can describe all pairs of subsets with equal means?
  \item What if the subsets in the pair need to be disjoint?
  \item Is there a way to combine two pairs of subsets into another pair?
  \item Can this generalize to multisets?
