Consider ways to lay matchsticks (of unit length) on the $n \times m$ grid in
such a way as to form a maze.

    Two mazes on a $(5 \times 4)$-cell grid.

\end{figure}
\begin{question}
  How many distinct mazes can be drawn on the grid?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if every $1\times1$ cell must be reachable?
  \item What if there are no dead ends?
  \item What if there are to be identically $k$ dead ends?
  \item What if paths that loop are not allowed?
  \item What if the entrance and exit have prescribed positions?
  \item What if this is done on a hexagonal or triangular grid? On a torus?
  \item Is there a meaningful way to assign ``difficulty'' to a maze?
\end{related}
\begin{note}
  This appears to be the number of spanning trees on the $n \times m$ grid graph
  such that the start and end are leaves.
