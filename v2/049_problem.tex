Consider a $2$-coloring of a triangular grid of length $\ell$. Then label each
cell with its greatest number of neighbors of one color.\\\vspace{0.5cm}

    The second cell (reading top to bottom and left to right) is labeled with a
    $\max(3, 1) = 3$ because it has $3$ blue neighbors and $1$ red neighbor.

\begin{question}
  How many colorings exist of a length $\ell$ triangle such that the maximum
  label is $3$?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item If the ``number triangle'' is summed for each coloring, which coloring
    has the smallest sum?
  \item How does this generalize for a $k$-coloring?
  \item How does this generalize to a $n \times m$ square grid where
    horizontal-vertical connections are counted? Diagonal connections? Both?
  \item How does this generalize to a tetrahedron, torus, M\"obius strip,
    cylinder, or cube?
  \item How many colorings exist of a length $\ell$ triangle such that the maximum
    label is $4$ or $5$?
