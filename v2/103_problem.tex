The Snake Cube is \begin{quote}
  a mechanical puzzle, a chain of $27$ or $64$ cubelets, connected by an elastic
  band running through them. The cubelets can rotate freely. The aim of the
  puzzle is to arrange the chain in such a way that they will form
  $3 \times 3 \times 3$ or $4 \times 4 \times 4$ cube.

\begin{question}
  How many chains exists for an $n \times n \times n$ cube?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item How about for an $n \times m \times p$ rectangular prism?
  \item Can the ``hardest'' puzzles be quantified? Perhaps those with the
  greatest or fewest number of solutions?
  \item Can this be generalized to higher dimensions?
  \item Can this be generalized to other polytopes?
