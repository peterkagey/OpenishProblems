Consider the two-player game on a $n$-letter string on the alphabet $\{a,b\}$
where players take turns removing palindromic substrings of their choosing.

\begin{question}
  How many $n$-letter games does Player 1 have a winning strategy?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What is a winning strategy?
  \item If the game is chosen uniformly at random, what is the probability that
    the first player has
  \item What if players take turns according to the Thue-Morse sequence?
  \item What if players collect points based on the number of $1$s they erase?
  \item What if this is played on a larger alphabet?
  \item What if instead of palindromes, players remove $AA$ subwords,
    $ABA$ subwords, or other patterns?
  \item In a single-player version of the game, where the goal is to finish in
    as few moves a possible, which $n$-letter games require the most moves?
