A Heronian $2$-simplex (triangle) is a triangle with both integer sides and
integer area. A Heronian $n$-simplex is an $n$-simplex with integer volume and
where all sides are Heronian $(n - 1)$-simplices.

\begin{question}
  Do Heronian $n$-simplices exist for all integers $n$?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item Do infinitely many primitive Heronian $n$-simplices exist for each $n$?
  \item What is the smallest Heronian $n$-simplex
    as measured $k$-dimensional volume of the largest $k$-face?
    as measured by sum volume of $k$-faces? (These agree when $k=n$.)
  \item Are all Heronian $n$-simplices lattice simplices, as is the case for
    $n \leq 3$?
  \item What if the definition is relaxed so that only, say, the volume and the
    edge-lengths must be integers?
  \item Are other ``Heronian polytopes'' lattice polytopes, where a
    Heronian polytope is polytope where the $k$-dimensional volume of every
    $k$-face is an integer.
