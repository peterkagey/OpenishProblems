A Heronian $2$-simplex (triangle) is a triangle with both integer sides and
integer area. A Heronian $n$-simplex is an $n$-simplex with integer volume and
where all sides are Heronian $(n - 1)$-simplices.

\begin{question}
  Do Heronian $n$-simplices exist for all integers $n$?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item Do infinitely many primitive Heronian $n$-simplices exist for each $n$?
  \item What is the smallest Heronian $n$-simplex for each $n$ as measured by
    volume? As measured by largest side? As measured by sum of sides?
    As measured by ``surface area'' (sum of volume of $(n-1)$-degree facets)?
  \item Are all Heronian $n$-simplices lattice simplices?
  \item What if the definition is relaxed so that only the volume and the
    edges must be integers?
