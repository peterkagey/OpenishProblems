\begin{question}
  What is the largest number of squares that can be nested?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What is the maximum sum of the areas? Perimeters?
  \item How many maximal configurations exist?
  \item What if the nested squares must be ``snug'', that is, all four of their
  corners must be on their outer neighbor.
  \item What if the nested squares cannot be parallel
    (i.e every square must be a scaling \textit{and} a rotation of another square)?
  \item What if they don't need to be centered, but instead no two squares can
    share a lattice point? If no two squares can be parallel?
  \item What if this is done on a triangular or hexagonal lattice?
