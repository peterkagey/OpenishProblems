According to Wikipedia
\begin{quote}
  A Johnson solid is a strictly convex polyhedron for which each face
  is a regular polygon.
\end{quote}
Let $\operatorname{Hull}(P)$ denote the convex hull of a polygon $P$.
Say that a $1$-concave Johnson solid is a polyhedra $P$ with regular polygonal
faces (such that no two faces lay the same plane) and with the property that the
``concave'' part $\operatorname{Hull}(P) - P$ is a connected convex polyhedron.

\begin{question}
  Excluding infinite families of $1$-concave Johnson solids
  (e.g. prisms with a square pyramid removed),
  are there a finite number of $1$-concave Johnson solids?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if the ``co-planar'' restriction is relaxes so that no two
    \textit{adjacent} faces may lie in the same plane?
  \item How many $1$-concave Johnson solids have a convex hull that is a
    Johnson solid?
  \item Say that a $2$-concave Johnson solid $P$ is a polyhedra with regular
    polygonal faces such that
    $P' = \operatorname{Hull}(P) - P$ is a connected polyhedron, and
    $\operatorname{Hull}(P') - P'$ is a connected convex polyhedron.
    Outside of infinite families,
    are there a finite number of $2$-concave Johnson solids?
    $n$-concave Johnson solids?
  \item Are all $n$-concave Johnson solids homeomorphic to a sphere?
  \item Do there exist $k$-concave Johnson solids for all $k$?
