Consider polyominoes where each cell has one of $n$ colors, and
each distinct pair of colors is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to each other
somewhere in the polyomino. Let an $n$-minimum polyomino be one that has the
minimum number of cells.

\begin{question}
  How many such $n$-minimum polyominoes exist?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What if the ``distinct'' restriction is lifted?
    (e.g. a blue label must somewhere be adjacent to another blue label.)
  \item What is a way to determine the size of an $n$-minimum polyomino for
    large $n$?
  \item What if this is done on a triangular or hexagonal grid?
  \item What if this is done on a three dimensional cube lattice?
\end{related}

\begin{note}
  This is closely related to the following problem: given a finite graph $G$,
  let $f(G) = n$ where $n$ is the largest integer such that there exists a
  quotient $G/\sim$ that is isomorphic to the complete graph $K_n$. Is there
  an efficient way to compute $f$?

  Is the symmetric polynomial for $G$ which enumerates the labelings that
  quotient $G$ into a complete graph known or interesting?
