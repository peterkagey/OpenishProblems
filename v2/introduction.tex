This is a catalog of open problems that I began in late 2017 to keep tabs on
different problems and ideas I had been thinking about.

Each problem consists of an introduction, a figure which illustrates an example,
a question, and a list related questions. Some problems also have references
which refer to other problems, to the OEIS, or to other web references.

\begin{section}{Rating}
  Each problem is rated both in terms of how difficult and how interesting I think the problem is.
  \begin{subsection}{Difficulty} The difficulty score follows the convention of
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piste#North_America,_New_Zealand_and_Australia}{ski trail difficulty ratings}.
  \begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \difficulty{1}
      & Easiest
      & The problem should be solvable with a modest amount of effort.
    \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
    %
    \difficulty{2}
      & Moderate
      & Significant progress should be possible with moderate effort.
    \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
    %
    \difficulty{3}
      & Difficult
      & Significant progress will be difficult or take substantial insight.
    \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
    %
    \difficulty{4}
      & Most difficult
      & The problem may be intractable, but special cases may be solvable.
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  \end{subsection}
  \begin{subsection}{Interest}
    The interest rating follows a four-point scale. Each roughly describes what
    quartile I think it belongs in with respect to my interest in it.
    \begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
      \score{1}
        & Least interesting
        & These problems have an interesting idea, but may feel contrived.
      \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
      %
      \score{2}
        & More interesting
        & Either a somewhat complicated or somewhat superficial question.
      \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
      %
      \score{3}
        & Very interesting
        & Problems that are particularly natural or simple or cute.
      \\[1mm] \hline \\[-3mm]
      %
      \score{4}
        & Most interesting
        & These are the problems that I care the most about.
    \end{tabular}
