  How many non-intersecting walks from $(1,1)$ to $(n, m)$ with steps up and to
  the right exist on the $n \times m$ torus?

\begin{question}
  How many such walks exist?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if the walks must touch every lattice point?
  \item What if the walks must wrap around the torus exactly $k$ times?
  (For $k = 1$ and $m = n$, this is the number of walks along the edges of an
  $n \times n$ non-toroidal grid.)
  \item What if there always must be weakly more ``up'' steps than ``right''
    steps? (generalization of staying above the diagonal) Strongly more?
  \item What if this is done on a cylinder? M\"obius strip? More dimensions?
  \item What if walks can intersect at a right angle? What if there must be exactly $k$ intersections?
  \item What if more general loops were counted? (i.e. any walk from $(0,0)$ to $(0,m), (n,0)$ or $(n,m)$.)
