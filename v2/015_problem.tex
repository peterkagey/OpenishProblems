Ron Graham's (A006255) sequence is the least integer $k$ for which there exists
a strictly increasing integer sequence \[
  n = a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_t = k
\]
such that $a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdots a_t$ is square.

\begin{question}
  Does there exist any $n$ for which $A006255(n) = A072905(n)$. In other words,
  is there any nonsquare $n$ for which $n \cdot A006255(n)$ is square?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item Does the gap $A072905(n) - A006255(n)$ have a nonzero lower bound?
  \item Does this idea generalize to cubes, powers of four, etc?
\end{related}

\begin{note}
  A006255 is bounded above by A072905, the least $k > n$ such that $kn$
  is square.

  \noindent
  This is equivalent to showing that for any $a < b$ with the same
  squarefree part, there is some subset of $\{ a + 1, a + 2, \hdots, b - 1 \}$
  such that the product of the elements of the subset has the same squarefree
  part as $a$ (and $b$).
