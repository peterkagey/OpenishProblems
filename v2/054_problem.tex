Consider convex polygons with integer coordinates. The notion of a best
Diophantine approximation can be generalized to equilateral triangles by
saying that a triangle is a better diophantine approximation if
the ratio of the largest side to the smallest side is less than the ratio of
any other triangle with smaller perimeter.

    Four best (?) Diophantine approximations of an equilateral triangle.
    The red triangle has a ratio of $\sqrt{2/1} \approx 1.41$,
    the blue has a ratio of $\sqrt{5/4} \approx 1.118$,
    the orange has a ratio of $\sqrt{18/17} \approx 1.029$, and
    the green has a ratio of $\sqrt{64/63} \approx 1.008$.

\begin{question}
  What is the growth of the perimeter of the $k$-th best Diophantine
  approximation of an equilateral triangle as a function of $k$?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item How can this be generalized in a reasonable way to regular $n$-gons?
    (Just looking at side lengths isn't enough---angles can behave badly.)
  \item What if this is done on tetrahedra?
