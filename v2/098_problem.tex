  Suppose you choose two points on a line segment uniformly at random, defining
  three smaller line segments. The probability that these three line segments
  satisfy the triangle inequality is $\frac 14$.
  \\
  Similarly, if you choose five points on a line segment, it is conjectured that
  they can form a tetrahedron with probability $\frac 1{79}$.

\begin{question}
  If the line segment is split into $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ pieces using this
  prescription, do the resulting segments form a $k$-simplex with rational
  probability?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if the segments form prescribed sides of the $k$-simplex? What if
    any configuration is valid?
  \item What if there are more than $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ pieces, what is the
    probability that there exists some subset of $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ of them that
    forms a $k$-simplex?
  \item What is the expected hyper-volume of such a tetrahedron?
