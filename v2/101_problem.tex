In a letter, Alec Jones asks notes that there are eleven distinct nets of the
cube, considered as free polyominoes.

    Eleven distinct nets of the ($3$-hyper)cube.
    Two, marked in yellow, have reflection symmetry, that is they are achiral;
    four, marked in blue, have rotational symmetry.

\begin{question}
  Alec asks, how many nets are there of the $n$-hypercube?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item How many of the nets exhibit some sort of symmetry, as shown in the example.
  \item How many nets are there of the $n$-simplex? Other polyhedra?
  \item How many nets for a rectangular analog? That is for some $a_1, a_2, \hdots, a_n$, \[
    R = \{(x_1, x_2, \hdots, x_n) : x_i = 0 \text{ or } x_i = a_i\}.
  \] Note that in the case of the $n$-hypercube, $a_1 = a_2 = \hdots = a_n = 1$.
  \item Must all of these nets ``use up'' $n$ dimensions.
  (In the case of $n=3$ in the example, yes, because the ``straight line''
  $6$-omino cannot be folded into a cube.)
  \item What is the net with the smallest convex hull by hypervolume? Largest?
  \item How many of the nets tile $(n-1)$-space?
\end{related}

\begin{note}
  There is $1$ net for the $2$-hypercube, $11$ nets for the $3$-hypercube,
  and $261$ nets for the $4$-hypercube.
  The answer is unknown for the $5$-hypercube.
  The corresponding sequence is tagged ``hard'' on OEIS.
