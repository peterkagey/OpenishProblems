\begin{document}
  Suppose that there is a ``cop'' and a ``robber'' in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where the
  cop can move along the two continuous vector fields $F$ and $G$ at a speed
  $v$, and the robber can move anywhere in the plane with a speed $u$.
\begin{question}
  Is there a procedure for determining in general who has a winning strategy?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item Is there a procedure that can put a bound on the amount of time it will
    take for the cop to catch the robber?
  \item How does this generalize to a torus, M\"obius strip, or cylinder?
