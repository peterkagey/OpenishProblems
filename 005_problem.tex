Let a ``popsicle stick weave'' be a configuration of lines segments, called ``sticks'', such that
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
  \item when you lift up any stick by the end, the structure supports itself (is in tension)
  \item the removal of any stick results in a configuration that no longer supports itself.
\end{enumerate}

    Four of five (?) known examples of five-stick crossings.
    Perhaps the fourth example shouldn't count, because shortening the blue
    stick to avoid the blue-red crossing results in a valid configuration
    (the remaining known five-stick crossing).

\begin{question}
  How many distinct popsicle stick weaves exist for $n$ sticks?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if the sticks are only allowed to touch three other sticks?
  \item What if the sticks are another geometric object (e.g. semicircles)?
