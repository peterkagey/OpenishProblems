Euler's well is a labeling of the $n \times k$ grid with a permutation in
$S_{n \times k}$ such that the upper left corner is labeled with $1$.
\begin{quote}
  Water is poured into the well from a point above the section marked 1, at the rate of 1 cubic foot per minute. Assume that water entering a region of constant depth immediately disperses to all orthogonally adjacent lower-depth regions evenly along that regionâ€™s exposed perimeter (an assumption that Euler insisted on).

After how many minutes will the water begin to accumulate in
[the lower right corner]?
\end{quote}

\begin{question}
  For a random permtation in $S_{n \times k}$, what is the expected amount of
  time it takes for water to reach the lower right hand corner of the grid?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if water can flow diagonally?
  \item What if the source or sink are in different places? What if there are
  multiple sources/sinks?
  \item What if this is done on a torus? Triangular/hexagonal grid? Three
  dimensions?
  \item What if the numbers are not neccesarily a permutation?
  \item What if the well is a Latin square?
  \item What is an efficient algorithm for computing this for an arbitrary
  permutation?
  \item What is the expected value of number of ``wet'' squares at the end?
  \item How many wells have minimal filling times?
  \item How many wells up to ``fill level''? (e.g. two wells are equivalent if
  each square has the same height after the water flows all the way)
