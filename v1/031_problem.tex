A country has a strange legislative procedure.
For each bill, the body is split up into $k_1$ committees of
$\lfloor n/k_1 \rfloor$ or $\lfloor n/k_1 \rfloor$ legislators each,
each of which picks a representative. These $k_1$ representatives are split up
into $k_2$ sub-committees with
$\lfloor k_1/k_2 \rfloor$ or $\lfloor k_1/k_2 \rfloor$ legislators each, which
each elect a representative, and so on until $k_T=1$ and the final committee
votes on the bill.

There are a few rules: \begin{enumerate}
  \item Each committee (and subcommittee and so on) much have at least $\ell$
    members.
  \item Ties are settled by a coin toss.
  \item The president does not get to vote, but she does get to choose the
    number of committees and who goes in each one.
  \item There are $\alpha$ supporters who will always vote in the
  president's interests and $n-\alpha$ who will always vote against.
\end{enumerate}
Let $a_\ell(n)$ be the minimum number of supporters ($\alpha$) required for
the president to be able to pass every bill.

\begin{question}
  What is an efficient way to compute $a_\ell(n)$ for general $\ell$ and $n$?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What if the president gets to choose who is on each committee but the
    opposition party gets to choose the committee size? Vice versa?
  \item What if $k_1 \leq k_2 \leq \hdots \leq k_T$? Or $k_1 \geq k_2 \geq \hdots \geq k_T$?
  \item What if ties go to the president? To the opposition?
