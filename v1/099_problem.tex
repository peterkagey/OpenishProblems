According to Peter Winkler's problem ``Red and Blue Dice'' in
\textit{Mathematical Mind-Benders}, given two sequences of length $n$ with
letters in $[n]$, there must always exist a (nonempty) subsequence in each such
that the sum of each of the subsequences are equal.
Furthermore, there must exist a \textit{substring} (i.e. contiguous subset) in
both such that the sum of each substring is equal.

\begin{question}
  How many equal-sum subsequences (respectively substrings) are guaranteed to
  exist?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What if the subsequence or substring must have length greater than or
    equal to $k$?
  \item What if the subsequences or substrings must be of equal length?
  \item What if the substring is allowed to wrap around?
  \item What if this is done over permutations $S_n$ instead of subsets $[n]^n$?
  \item What if the sequences are of length $\ell < n$, and must be injections
  from $\mathbb N$ to $[n]$?
  \item What if there are three sequences? $m$ sequences?
  \item Given two random sequences, what is the expected number of equal-sum
  subsequences?
