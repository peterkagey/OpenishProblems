Let $G$ be some $n \times m$ grid as in Figure 1, where each cell has two
opposite diagonals connected (uniformly at random).
A cell is chosen (also uniformly at random), and the segment given by the path of
diagonals that goes through the selected cell is is inspected.

\begin{question}
  What is the expected length of the selected segment?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What is the expected number of segments in an $n \times m$ grid?
  \item How long is the longest segment expected to be?
  \item How does this change if the grid is toroidal, on a cylinder,
    on a M\"obius strip, etc?
