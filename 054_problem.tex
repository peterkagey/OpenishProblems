Let a palindromic partition be a partition of a string into palindromes.

\begin{question}
  Given some string, how many palindromic partitions does it have?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What is the least number of parts $p$ such that an arbitrary string of
    length $\ell$ over a $k$-letter alphabet can be partitioned into $p$ or
    fewer parts?
  \item What is the length of the shortest string that cannot be partitioned
    into fewer than $p$ parts?
  \item How many length $\ell$ strings require the ``worst-case'' number of
    parts?
  \item Which length $\ell$ strings have the greatest number of distinct
    partitions? The least?
  \item What is the smallest number of parts that any string with $m$ o's
    and an arbitrary number of x's can be partitioned into?
