Consider ways to partition the $n \times m$ grid so that no three tiles of the
same partition fall on a line.

    A $3$ partition of the $5 \times 3$ grid. The white circle cannot be in
    any of the existing partitions, otherwise three circles of the same
    color would fall on the same line.

\begin{question}
  How many colors are required to satisfy the ``no three in a row'' criterion?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What if this is generalized to $k$ in a row?
  \item What if this is generalized to a triangular or hexagonal grid?
  \item What if this is generalized to a torus or cylinder or M\"obius strip?
  \item What if this only queen moves or rook moves are considered?
  \item How many distinct configurations exist with a minimal number of partitions?
  \item How many distinct configurations exist with $k$ partitions?
