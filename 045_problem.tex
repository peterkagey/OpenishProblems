  From correspondence with Alec Jones: Consider a game played on the
  $m \times n$ rectangular grid, where players take turns placing their pieces
  onto the board. Each player gets a point for each 3-in-a-row that they make.

\begin{question}
  Which player has a winning strategy?
\end{question}
\begin{related}
  \item What is the score differential under perfect play?
  \item If players cooperate, what is the greatest score differential?
  \item What if this is generalized to a torus or cylinder or M\"obius strip?
  \item What if the game is played with $k$ players or requires $\ell$-in-a-row?
  \item What if the game is played on a triangular grid?
  \item What if the game is played in $d$ dimensions?
