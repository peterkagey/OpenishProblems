  Let $U_n$ be the set of sequences of positive integers of length $n$ such that
  no substring occurs twice.

\begin{question}
  What is th enumber of sequences in $U_n$ where the sum of terms is minimized?
\end{question}

\begin{related}
  \item What is the minimum least common multiple of a sequence in $U_n$?
    How many such minimal sequences?
  \item What is the minimum product of a sequence in $U_n$?
    How many such minimal sequences?
  \item What if substrings are considered forward and backward?
  \item What if only substrings of length greater $k$ are considered?
  \item What is any term can appear at most $\ell$ times?
